# BTC-Hackathon - BitGovern ðŸš€

Managing DAOs requires technical expertise, creating high entry barriers and inefficiencies. Our project aims to streamline DAO activities, including governance and tokenomics, through a decentralized infrastructure. By lowering these barriers, we enhance accessibility and efficiency, enabling broader participation and user-friendly DAO management for communities, organizations, and individuals.

## How It's Made 

BitGovern combines a variety of advanced technologies to create a seamless DAO management experience. At its core, BitGovern is built on Ethereum smart contracts, which automate essential DAO operations like governance, voting, and tokenomics, allowing for customizable and flexible governance settings tailored to each DAO's needs. All smart contracts are deployed on the Rootstock testnet network, providing a secure and scalable environment for development and testing, ensuring optimal performance before mainnet deployment.

The platformâ€™s integration with Discordâ€™s API is a crucial component, automatically creating private, token-gated channels for each DAO. This integration ensures that only eligible members can access specific channels, enhancing security and engagement. Users are added or removed dynamically based on their token holdings, and a dedicated bot provides real-time updates on key DAO activities, such as proposal creation and voting, directly within the Discord channels.
